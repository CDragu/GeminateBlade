# GeminateBlade
Found this interesting concept on Reddit the other day and I liked the design of the daggers/blades so much that I wanted to do something with them. I ended up modeling them in Maya and then making a nice scene in Unity. The reflections on the blade are made with render textures, one for each blade. Maybe a multi layer texture to gibe a dirty look to the blade or something, but it already is hard to see something through them.
